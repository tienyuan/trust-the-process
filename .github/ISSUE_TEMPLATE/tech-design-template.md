## Tech Design
Outline in enough detail for a team member to understand, and implement. 

Please consider adding:
- questions that need product/design clarification
- examples for specific use cases, test case, corner cases
- logic, states, scenes, VIP, workers, ui
- performance choices
- maintenance choices
- flowcharts, pictures :-)
---

## Alternatives
What other designs have been considered? There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

Please consider:
- implementation cost, both in term of code size, complexity and time
- the impact on maintenance, code readability
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing codebase (is it a breaking change?)
